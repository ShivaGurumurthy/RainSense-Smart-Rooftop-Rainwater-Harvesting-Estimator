# RainSense  
### A Smart Estimator for Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting Potential  

***

## 1. Introduction

RainSense is a Python-based command-line tool developed to estimate the quantity of rainwater that can be harvested from rooftop surfaces. The system provides accurate and scalable predictions using preprocessed rainfall datasets, while eliminating the need for manual user inputs beyond the location. By integrating data-driven estimation with sustainable design concepts, RainSense supports informed decision-making for water storage, conservation, and groundwater recharge planning.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives of RainSense are:

- To develop a comprehensive yet lightweight estimation tool for rooftop rainwater harvesting.  
- To leverage pre-fed rainfall datasets for automatic estimation with minimal user input.  
- To implement fixed efficiency and loss constants for scientific consistency across runs.  
- To support both individual analysis (single site) and potential scalability for batch or regional assessments.  
- To promote sustainable water management through accurate and accessible technology.

## 3. Problem Statement

With increasing urban water demands and declining groundwater levels, rainwater harvesting is a sustainable solution for reducing water stress. However, existing estimation tools often require detailed user inputs or complex simulation setups. There is a need for a simple, reliable, and automated system that accurately estimates harvesting potential using standard datasets and predefined physical constants.  

RainSense addresses this challenge by automatically computing water collection potential from roofing structures—without requiring technical expertise from the end user.

## 7. Working Principle and Formula

The estimated volume of harvestable rainwater (in liters) is computed using:

$$
\text{Rainwater Harvest (L)} = \text{Rainfall (mm)} \times \text{Roof Area (m²)} \times \text{Roof Efficiency} \times \text{Pipe Efficiency} \times \text{Absorption Efficiency}
$$

### Default Constants
- Roof Material Efficiency: Concrete (0.85), Metal (0.95), Tile (0.80)  
- Pipe Loss Efficiency: 0.95  
- Absorption Loss Efficiency: 0.90  
- Standard Tank Capacity: 1000 Liters

## 8. Sample Output

Example output for a given location:

```
Enter location: Bengaluru
Roof Material: Concrete
Estimated Rainwater Harvest: 84,500 L
Tank Filled: 1,000 L
Groundwater Recharge: 83,500 L
```

Optional visualization (bar chart):  
- X-axis: Months  
- Y-axis: Harvested Water (Liters)

## 9. Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|------------|-----------|
| Handling location-specific rainfall data | Introduced automated location mapping with fallback averages |
| Managing multiple constants | Centralized all constants in `constants.py` |
| Simplifying user inputs | Restricted to a single required input (location) |
| Ensuring usability | Developed an intuitive CLI with informative prompts and formatted outputs |

## 10. Results and Conclusion

RainSense successfully provides quantitative estimates of rooftop rainwater that can be captured and stored. It demonstrates the efficiency of pre-fed data-driven systems in modeling sustainable water management decisions. The project validates the potential for such tools to aid both individuals and urban planners in estimating and optimizing water collection capacities.
